# NodeJS Email sender using nodemailer

Send Emails automatically from your own projects.

## Npm packages used:

[Nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer)

```bash
npm i nodemailer
```

```nodejs
sendEmail("Recipent","Subject","Content/Html",false)
```
If you'd like to send HTML code inside the email instead of plain text, change the last argument to true.
